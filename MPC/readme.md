# Model Predictive Control (MPC)

## Installation

All the python requirements are present in `requirements.txt`
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### `main.py`
#### Running with given paths
---
First, change the parameters in the `config.toml` file according to the requirement. Then run `main.py`.
```
python main.py
```

#### Using a custom path
---
To do this, add a function to the dict `ref_courses`  that returns your custom path. This path can then be selected by specifying the corresponding number in the `config.toml` .
The would be the recommended way as the user will have an option to quickly switch between paths by just changing the config. 

### `mpc.py`
This module has 2 classes.
State: holds information about the robot state
MPC: holds the MPC specific information, non-linear solver, cost functions for unicycle and bicycle model and some other helper functions

Note: This file cannot be run as is. It must be imported into another file that calls the solver. Check `main.py` file for reference usage
